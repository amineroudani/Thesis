# Investigating the Loss Landscape for ODE Parameter Inference

This repository contains the materials and code for my thesis, *Investigating the Loss Landscape for ODE Parameter Inference*. The work focuses on parameter estimation challenges in differential equation models, with a detailed exploration of the exponential growth model. 

## Abstract

The thesis investigates the loss function landscape in parameter estimation problems, emphasizing the role of noise, data quantity, and data distribution in shaping minima distributions. Key contributions include:
- **Transforming Loss Functions into Polynomials**: Leveraging algebraic techniques such as Gr√∂bner bases and Homotopy Continuation for robust analysis.
- **Impact Analysis**: Studying how noise, the number of data points, and their distribution affect minima in the loss function.
- **Extension to Two-Dimensional Models**: Exploring the applicability of these methodologies in higher-dimensional parameter spaces.

This work enhances the theoretical framework for parameter estimation in differential equations and provides a foundation for extending these methods to more complex models.
